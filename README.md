# FolderManager
Fast folder and file's indexer

Install:
1.- cd to location
2.- py files.py
3.- enjoy

I made this cause I store big amount of files, in this way I can move between folders and files faster, without loading all the UI that I dont need.

Uses:
Recursive search in given path
Open any file or folder
Tog files view to only see folders
Whatever you want to add.
